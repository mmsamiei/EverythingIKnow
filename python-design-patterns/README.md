# Python Design Patterns

## What is design pattern?

A design pattern is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context. In everyday work, a programmer faces issues that have been solved so many times in the past by other developers that they have evolved common patterns to solve them. They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code. The pattern is not a specific piece of code, but a general concept for solving a particular problem.

## What are the advantages of design patterns?

The design pattern accelerates the development process, providing a proven practice to solve some type of problem. It is often more preferable than using an unproven one because invisible problems often occur during the implementation, and the solving of unforeseen problems slows down the development dramatically.

Besides that, it's a tool of communication between programmers. It's much easier to say, "We use here the observer design pattern" rather than describing what the code actually does.

## What categories does design pattern split into?

three categories: **creational**, **structural**, and **behavioral**.

creational patterns: These patterns deal with different aspects of object creation. Their goal is to provide better alternatives for situations where direct object creation, which in Python happens within the **init**\(\) function, is not convenient.
