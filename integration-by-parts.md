# Integration by parts

In calculus, and more generally in mathematical analysis, **integration by parts** or **partial integration** is a process that finds the **integral of a product of functions** in terms of the **integral of the product of their derivative and antiderivative**.

$$
\int{u\ dv} = uv- \int{v\ du}
$$
